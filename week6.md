## Week 6 — Network Connectivity and Services

### Tasks Completed

- Checked local network configuration using `ip addr`
- Verified external connectivity with `ping`
- Confirmed DNS resolution by pinging a hostname
- Listed listening network services using `ss -tuln`

### Week 6 Summary

In Week 6, I explored basic Linux networking tools used to verify connectivity and running services.
Using `ip addr`, I identified the IP addresses assigned to my Ubuntu system.  
I then ran `ping` to reach an external IP address and a domain name, confirming both internet
access and working DNS resolution.  
Finally, I used `ss -tuln` to list active listening ports and see which services were available
on the system. These steps helped me understand how to quickly diagnose common network issues.
