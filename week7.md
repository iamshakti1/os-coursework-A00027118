# Week 7 — Shell Scripting and System Reporting
### 🧠 Final Reflection

Over the course of Weeks 1 to 7, I developed a deeper understanding of Linux system administration and the core principles behind operating systems. Starting from basic setup and user management, I progressed through file permissions, compression, process control, networking, and automation with shell scripting. Each task strengthened my ability to use command-line tools effectively and to think systematically when solving problems. This journal reflects my growth in both technical skills and confidence using Linux for real-world system management tasks.

## Tasks Completed
- Created a simple `script1.sh` to print a greeting, date, current directory and list files.
- Made the script executable and ran it from the terminal.
- Wrote `system_report.sh` to collect system information into `system_report.txt`.
- Captured disk usage and top memory-using processes using commands like `df -h` and `ps aux`.

## Week 7 Summary
In Week 7, I learned how shell scripts can automate routine system administration tasks.  
I started with a basic script that echoed system details, then created a more advanced
`system_report.sh` script which gathers the date, uptime, disk usage and the top memory-using
processes into a report file. This helped me understand how to combine Linux commands,
redirection and permissions to build useful, repeatable tools.
