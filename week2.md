## Week 2 — User Management and Privileges

### Tasks Completed
- Created users `student1` and `student2`
- Tested user permissions and `sudo` privileges
- Verified `apt update` access and restrictions

### Week 2 Summary
In Week 2, I focused on **user management and privilege control** in Ubuntu. I created two new users, `student1` and `student2`, and assigned them appropriate group memberships. I then tested their permissions using administrative commands like `sudo apt update`. The results showed that `student1` could successfully run administrative tasks after being added to the `sudo` group, while `student2` received an error due to lacking sudo privileges. This exercise demonstrated how Linux user accounts and privilege levels can be managed effectively to maintain system security.
