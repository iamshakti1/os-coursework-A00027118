## Week 3 — File Management and Permissions

### Tasks Completed
- Created directory `permissions_test` and file `testfile.txt`
- Modified file permissions using `chmod`
- Changed ownership using `chown`
- Tested file access for `student1` and `student2`

### Week 3 Summary
In Week 3, I learned how Linux file permissions and ownership control user access.  
Using commands such as `chmod` and `chown`, I was able to restrict file access so that only the owner  
(student1) could read the file, while another user (student2) was denied permission.  
This helped me understand how permissions (read, write, execute) and ownership keep files secure.
